# LaptopPricePrediction
# Introduction of the Dataset
A laptop price prediction dataset typically contains a variety of features and attributes of laptops that can be used to train machine learning models for predicting laptop prices. These features may include specifications such as processor speed, RAM, storage capacity, display size and resolution, graphics card, brand, and model.

The dataset may also include other variables that can affect the laptop price, such as the release date, location, and retail store information. Additionally, the dataset may contain historical pricing data for each laptop, which can be used to train and validate the accuracy of the prediction models.

# Dataset Columns

Company: The name of the laptop brand, such as Acer, Apple, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, or MSI.

Product: The specific model of the laptop, such as Aspire 3, MacBook Air, ROG Strix G15, or ThinkPad E14.

TypeName: The general category of the laptop, such as Ultrabook, Notebook, Gaming, or Workstation.

Inches: The size of the laptop screen, measured diagonally in inches.

ScreenResolution: The screen resolution of the laptop, such as 1920x1080, 1366x768, or 3840x2160.

CPU: The processor type and speed, such as Intel Core i5-7200U or AMD Ryzen 5 2500U.

RAM: The amount of random-access memory (RAM) in the laptop, measured in gigabytes (GB).

Memory: The storage capacity of the laptop, measured in gigabytes (GB).

GPU: The graphics card type and memory, such as NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 with 4GB GDDR5.

OpSys: The operating system installed on the laptop, such as Windows 10, macOS, or Linux.

Weight: The weight of the laptop, measured in kilograms (kg).
